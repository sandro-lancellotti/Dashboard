# Dashboard

![](https://github.com/sandro-lancellotti/Dashboard/blob/master/dashboard.gif)

The code in the file MultipleDash.py generates a dashboard with some information about temperature and altitude of some cities in Basilicata (Italy). 
The user can select the kind of temperature(minimum, average and maximum) and the month of interest. 
-The first is a regression plot (altitude vs average temperature in the month over 20 years). 
-The second is an heatmap of the Basilicata region, the colours represent the average temperature in the month over 20 years. 
-The third represents in red the shape of the regression line of the first plot and in blue the shape referred to only one year. 
-The fouth is a KPI that represent the expected incrementation of temperature increasing the altitude by 1 mt.

Hovering the mouse over the points displays additional information such as the location, year or altitude of the station.
